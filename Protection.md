# Branch Protection Rules

## Why These Rules Matter

1. **Require Pull Request Reviews**:
   - Ensures code is reviewed by peers before merging, reducing the chance of bugs.
   - Promotes collaborative development and shared accountability.

2. **Require Status Checks**:
   - Enforces automated testing to maintain code quality.
   - Blocks merging of broken or untested code.

3. **Disable Direct Pushes**:
   - Ensures all changes are documented and reviewed through pull requests.
   - Maintains an auditable history of all changes.
